- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m tazin Ahamed Supti.

An ordinary tech freak girl, born and brought up in a small town in Bangladesh. From my childhood, I've been a curious and enthusiastic individual with a passion for learning and a zest for life.
I find joy in exploring new ideas, cultures, and experiences. I firmly believe in the power of knowledge and its ability to positively shape our world. 

From a great interest in computer science and technology, after obtaining a GPA of 5.00 in both secondary and higher secondary with a government scholarship
I completed my graduation with a degree in Software engineering and Iâ€™m thrilled to embark on my journey in the world of technology.
During my time at university, I not only gained a solid foundation in computer science and software development but also honed my ability to work collaboratively on team projects.
I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments and have a knack for quickly adapting to new technologies and programming languages.
While working on different projects, I discovered myself deeply impassioned about the enthralling world of data analysis and data science.
I have a knack for taking messy data and transforming it into constructive information that can drive smart decision-making.

My strengths lie in various areas: 
I'm like a "data detective," skilled at collecting and cleaning data from all kinds of sources.
I enjoy crunching numbers and finding patterns through statistical analysis.
I love creating eye-catching charts and graphs to make complex data understandable, and I'm a coding enthusiast, fluent in languages like Python and R.
Managing data with MS Excel and databases using SQL is second nature to me. Plus, I'm always eager to learn more about different industries to apply my data skills effectively.

Professionally, I'm dedicated and goal-oriented.
I thrive in dynamic environments and have a track record of taking on challenges with a can-do attitude. Whether it's solving complex problems, collaborating with diverse teams, 
or adapting to new technologies, I embrace growth opportunities with enthusiasm.

Outside of work, I pursue my hobbies, which include reading books, photography, and doing some art. 
These activities not only provide a creative outlet but also offer valuable life lessons. 
I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and cherishing moments spent with family and friends.
Ultimately, I aspire to make a meaningful impact on the world, whether through my professional endeavors, personal passions, 
or by simply spreading positivity and kindness in my interactions with others. I look forward to the exciting journey ahead and the opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference along the way.
